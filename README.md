## About This Project
This project is a simple e-commerce shopping cart app built with Angular and TypeScript. Users can add products to their cart, view cart contents, and remove items—all managed with modern Angular features. 🛒

The goal of this project was to get started with Angular and explore its core concepts such as component architecture, state management with services and signals, and modern template features. I focused on building a simple, functional app to practice clean code structure, reusable components, and type safety with TypeScript. 👨‍💻
